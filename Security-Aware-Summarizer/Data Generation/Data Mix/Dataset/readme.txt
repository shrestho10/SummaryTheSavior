In this repo we aggregate all harmful, harmless, ambiguous prompts and questions respectively.

And in the other folder named data mix and final generation we create the mixture of prompt and question and generate our final data for finetune and evaluation.
All output csv files will be found at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Shagoto/Data-Generation-Summary/tree/main/After%20Data%20Generation%20Data
