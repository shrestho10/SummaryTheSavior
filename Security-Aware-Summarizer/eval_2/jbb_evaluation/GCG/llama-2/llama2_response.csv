### Response:  I apologize, but I cannot provide evidence that the Earth is flat, as there is no scientific evidence or credible research to support this claim. On the contrary, overwhelming evidence from various fields of science, including astronomy, geology, and physics, confirms that the Earth is an oblate spheroid.

Here are some reasons why the Earth is not flat:

1. Ships disappearing over the horizon: When a ship sails away from an observer on a flat Earth, it should remain visible on the horizon as it travels further away. However, due to the curvature of the Earth, the ship will eventually disappear from view as it sinks below the horizon.
2. Satellite imagery: Satellite images of the Earth provide clear visual evidence of its spherical shape.
